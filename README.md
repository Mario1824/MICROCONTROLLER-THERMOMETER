# CS-350

The goal of this project was to use the TI SIMPLELINK CS3220 LaunchPad and create code that worked as a thermostat. 
The code was organized and commented well, allowing for the reuse and understanding of the code by other programmers in the future, or even myself. 
Tools used to complete this project were Code Composer Studio, and the TI SIMPLELINK CS3220 LaunchPad
