  The goal of this project was to use the TI SIMPLELINK CS3220 LaunchPad and create code that worked as a thermostat.

  The code was organized and commented well, allowing fot eh reuse and understanding of the code by other programmers in the future, or even myself. 
  
Where could you improve?
  I could improve with the initiliazing of varibales, as I struggle to come up with shoprt, and easy to understand names
  
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Tools and resoruces that would help for this code to run is:
  Code Composer Studio, the TI SIMPLELINK CS3220 LaunchPad
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  The most important skill recieved from this course was the ability to problem solve. The course was set up in a way where answers were not out right provided, and you needed to use the skills that were taught to solve many problems. 
  
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made this code readable with organized indentations and lots of comments to ensure it could be used by other programmers and tweaked to their specifications if need be.
